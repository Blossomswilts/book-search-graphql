# GraphQL Book Search Engine
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
Given a starter code, I was tasked with switching it over to use GraphQL API with Apollo Server. I also had to refactor the RESTful API to use GraphQL queries and mutations. I also had to use Apollo Client to consume the GraphQL API.
With this book search engine, you can search for books and save them to your profile. You can also delete books from your profile.
